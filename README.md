# Uniud Timetable App

A cross-platform application, written in Flutter, which displays a curated and customizable timetable of the courses from my university.

## UI/UX

The application features a modern UI/UX which conforms with Google's last Material design guidelines (More informations on [Material.io](https://material.io)).

## The tech stack

The application is written in the **Dart** language on the **Flutter** framework.

## Modularity and expandability

The application is built with modularity in mind, hence easily expandable to support other universities' timetable APIs.

In the future I could document more about the right way to expand this application to support other universities, in the meantime you could guess it by looking at the code :)
